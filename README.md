# Task-Front-end
This is an exercise trying to reproduce an image admin user interface.

I have choosen a Bootrap template named Clearmina to develope the example, though its not finished.

I didint have a less file so I have made my style modifications on the css file named modifications.css

The table users is getting the data from https://randomuser.me/, with angular and bootrap in the same file.
Pagination and search in the data table is not finished.

There are a few things not finished like add buttons, pagination sorting.
